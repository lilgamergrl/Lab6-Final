# Lab 6: AI Coding Agents - Reflection

## Question 1: Pre-Workshop Survey
- [ ] I completed the pre-workshop survey
- [Survey link] (https://forms.gle/hUrsEfTtAaueKHe29)
---

## Question 2: What AI Agent/LLM will you be using? (ie: Claude, Co-pilot, Cursor,etc)
[Answer]

## Question 3: Effective Prompting Practice

### Part 3A: Basic Code Generation (Part 3.1.A)

**Purpose:** Generate initial implementation from assignment requirements

**Prompt:**
[Paste your actual prompt here]

**Output:**
[Summarize what code was generated]

**Test Results:**
- Tests passed: X/Y
- What's working:
- What's broken:

**Analysis:**
[Evaluate prompt effectiveness and what you'd change]

---

### Part 3B: Prompting to create code based on supplied tests (Part 3.1.B)
**Prompt:**
[Paste your actual prompt here]

**Output:**
[Summarize what code was generated]

**Test Results:**
- Tests passed: X/Y
- What's working:
- What's broken:

**Analysis:**
[Evaluate prompt effectiveness and what you'd change]

** Answer the below questions: **
- What is working?
- What is broken?
- Impressions of the prompt strength
- What did you learn about basic prompting?
- On a scale of 1-10 how accurate do you think AI was at debugging your code?
- How much of the code generated do you understand?
- If given an hour to prepare could you explain this code?

## Question 4: Hands-On AI Debugging Exercise

### Part 4A: Bug Identification

**Your Initial Bug Analysis:**
[List bugs you found before using AI]
- Bug 1:
- Bug 2:
- Bug 3:
- Confidence level for each: [high/medium/low]

**AI Prompt for Bug Identification:**
[Your prompt asking AI to find all bugs]

**AI Response (Summarized):**
- Bugs AI found:
  1.
  2.
  3.
- Bugs AI missed (if any):
- False positives (if any):

**Comparison:**
- Does the list match the expected bugs? [yes/no]
- Was AI able to find all bugs? [yes/no]
- Do you understand the bugs it found? [yes/no - explain]
- Did AI find bugs you missed? [list them]
- Did you find bugs AI missed? [list them]

### Part 4B: Bug Fixing Strategies

#### Strategy A: Fix All Bugs at Once

**Prompt Used:**
[Your prompt asking AI to fix all bugs]

**Test Results:**
- Tests passed: X/Y
- Bugs fixed correctly:
- Bugs not fixed:
- New bugs introduced (if any):

**Understanding Level:** [high/medium/low]

**Verification Steps:**
[How did you verify the fixes?]

**Pros:**
-

**Cons:**
-

---

#### Strategy B: Fix Bugs One by One (Max 2 bugs)

**Number of Prompts Used:** [X]

**Prompt 1:**
[First bug fix prompt]
- Tests passed after fix: X/Y
- Understanding: [explanation]

**Prompt 2:**
[Second bug fix prompt]
- Tests passed after fix: X/Y
- Understanding: [explanation]


**Understanding Level:** [high/medium/low]

**Verification Steps:**
[How did you verify each fix?]

**Pros:**
-

**Cons:**
-

### Part 4C: Strategy Comparison

**Which strategy was more effective? Why?**
[Your analysis]

**Which strategy helped you learn more? Why?**
[Your analysis]

**Which would you use in the future? Why?**
[Your analysis]

**Understanding of Each Fix:**
- Fix 1: [Explain in your own words why this fix works]
- Fix 2: [Explain in your own words why this fix works]
- Fix 3: [Explain in your own words why this fix works]

**Maintainability Assessment:**
- Can you modify this code in 6 months? [yes/no - why?]
- Is the abstraction level appropriate? [yes/no - why?]
- Can you explain every line of the fixed code? [yes/no - which parts are unclear?]
- Would you be comfortable maintaining this code? [yes/no - why?]

**What did you learn about debugging with AI?**
[Your reflection]

## Question 5: Reflection and Takeaways

### Key Lessons

1. What is one thing AI was not able to for you on this assignment?
   [Your answer]

2. **What surprised you most about working with AI for coding?**
   [Your answer]

3. **What's one specific way you'll change how you use AI for future assignments?**
   [Your answer]

4. **What's one thing you'll always do before accepting AI-suggested code?**
   [Your answer]

5. **When should you NOT use AI for an assignment?**
   [Your answer]

6. **How did considering maintainability change your approach to using AI?**
   [Your answer]

7. **Which prompting strategy (basic, planned, or debugging) was most effective? Why?**
   [Your answer]

### Best Practices Checklist

Commit to these practices going forward:

- [ ] I will always attempt problems myself before asking AI
- [ ] I will provide complete context in prompts
- [ ] I will ask AI to explain WHY, not just provide fixes
- [ ] I will verify every AI suggestion with tests
- [ ] I will only use code I can fully explain
- [ ] I will use AI as a tutor, not a solution generator
- [ ] I will be skeptical of AI responses and double-check them
- [ ] I will consider long-term maintainability
- [ ] I will use appropriate abstraction levels
- [ ] I will fix bugs incrementally when learning, not all at once
